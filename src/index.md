# Adrian Valenzuela
## Artist, Designer, & Developer.

Hello! I'm Adrian, a self-taught web developer with a focus on Ruby on Rails. I'm also a graphic designer and digital artist.
Welcome to my personal site where I [write](/posts) about code, art, music, food and a bunch of other things.

My books are opening in November and I'll be available for hire at the beginning of the month. You can [email](mailto:adrianvalenz.web@gmail.com) and 
we can discuss projects for the coming month.
